Notes
=====

This module just makes working with multihashes a bit nicer. `py-multihash <//github.com/carsonfarmer/py-multihash>`_
is only for encoding/decoding multihashes, and does not depend on other libraries. This module will depend on various
implementations for each hash. It currently uses `pycryptodome` exclusively, but this will likely change as new hashing
functions are added (we're currently missing the MurmurHash3 functions, a double sha2-256 implementation, and all the
Skein functions).
